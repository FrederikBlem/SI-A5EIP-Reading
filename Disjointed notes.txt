Messaging Systems

Messaging makes applications loosely coupled by communicating asynchronously, 
which also makes the communication more reliable 
because the two applications do not have to be running at the same time. 

Messaging Overview:
*	Channels - Message Channels is a virtual pipe that connects a sender to a receiver.
*	Messages - An atomic packet of data that can be transmitted on a channel.
		A sender application will try repeatedly to deliver the message until it succeeds.
*	Pipes and Filters - this architecture describes how multiple processing steps 
		can be chained together using channels. Useful fx. for receivers expecting different
		formats than that of the sender's.
*	Routing - A Message Router chooses what channels to send a message along for it to get
		to its intended target or at least the next router.
*	Transformation - A Message Translator (intermediate filter) converts the message from 
		one format to another.
*	Endpoints - coordinated Message Endpoints are like a bridge code that enables the 
		application to send and receive messages.
